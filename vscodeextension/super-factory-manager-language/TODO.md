- Button to download all examples from all categories --> Button should be located on the bottom bar, next to UTF-8 and similar, it will download every content from every url
Maybe making it a setting to keep the files?

- Setting for adding more examples from github (only) / local (should behave like the already setup for activity bar)

- Search bar on activity bar

- Icon changes from settings! More customizations!

- Improve warnings --> Those are hard

- Improve snippets --> Idea: Make it a configuration if someone wants to start a snippet with a specific key like @energy or @every

- Improve snippets --> Configuration for key words, not everybody likes "input" but "Input" or "INPUT"
